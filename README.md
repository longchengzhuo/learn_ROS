# Personal ROS Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal ROS (Robot Operating System) learning journey! This repository documents my progress, insights, and experiences as I explore ROS through a structured course. Each ROS package in this repository includes detailed notes and reflections on specific topics.

## Course Used
I am following the course available on **Bilibili**:  
[ROS Learning Course](https://space.bilibili.com/1101432368/lists/700208?type=season)

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to ROS, covering topics such as:
- ROS basics and core concepts
- ROS tools and utilities
- ROS communication mechanisms (topics, services, actions)
- ROS simulation and visualization
- Advanced topics like navigation, SLAM, and more

## Repository Structure
Each ROS package in this repository corresponds to a specific section of the course. Inside each package, you will find:
- **Code**: Implementation of ROS nodes, launch files, and configurations.
- **Notes**: Detailed learning notes and reflections on the topic.
